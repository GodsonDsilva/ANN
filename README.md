# Artifical Neural Network

Problem Defination : A bank is investigating a very high rate of customer leaving the bank. Here is a 10.000 records dataset to investigate and predict which of the customers are more likely to leave the bank soon.Â There are 13 Input features to one binary output which indicates that the customer will leave the bank or not. To solve this problem definition, Artifical Neural Network(ANN) is used using keras library. And more later to improve the performance of the predicted result  Dropout Regularization and Grid search is used to find the optimal hyper-parameters.
